# Codebase Audit Report - Figaroo
Date: July 8, 2025  
Project: figaroo  
Technology Stack: React TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI

## Executive Summary

This audit examined a React TypeScript UI generator application that allows users to create components through AI-powered generation. The project uses modern web technologies but has several critical issues that need addressing for production readiness.

## üêõ 3 Critical Bugs to Fix

### 2. **XSS Vulnerability with dangerouslySetInnerHTML**
- **Issue**: User-generated code is rendered without sanitization using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- **Location**: `src/components/GeneratedComponent.tsx:352`
- **Impact**: Potential XSS attacks if malicious code is injected
- **Risk Level**: High - Security vulnerability
- **Code**: 
  ```tsx
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: code }}
  ```
- **Fix Required**: Implement HTML sanitization or use safer rendering methods

### 3. **Poor Error Handling in Async Operations**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling with basic `alert()` calls and console errors
- **Location**: 
  - `src/components/Canvas.tsx:374-375`
  - Multiple alert() calls throughout components
- **Impact**: Poor user experience and debugging difficulties
- **Risk Level**: Medium - UX and maintenance issues
- **Fix Required**: Implement proper error boundaries and user-friendly error messaging

### 2. **Implement Proper State Management**
- **Current Issue**: Complex prop drilling and state scattered across components
- **Observed**: Canvas component has 20+ state variables, deep prop chains
- **Improvement**: Implement Context API or state management library (Redux Toolkit/Zustand)
- **Benefits**: Simplified component structure, better performance, easier maintenance


## üìã 3 Next Steps

### 2. **Implement Security and Performance Enhancements**
- **Priority**: High
- **Description**: Address security vulnerabilities and optimize performance
- **Tasks**:
  - Add HTML sanitization library (DOMPurify)
  - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Add React.memo for expensive components
  - Implement virtual scrolling for component lists
  - Add error boundaries throughout the application
- **Dependencies**: Security review, performance testing

### 3. **Establish Testing and Build Pipeline**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Set up comprehensive testing and CI/CD pipeline
- **Tasks**:
  - Add unit tests for core components (Jest/React Testing Library)
  - Implement integration tests for user workflows
  - Set up ESLint and Prettier configuration
  - Create package-lock.json for dependency management
  - Add GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
  - Set up monitoring and error tracking
- **Dependencies**: Testing strategy definition, CI/CD platform selection

## Additional Observations

### Code Quality Issues Found:
- **Console logs in production code**: 4 instances that should be removed
- **Hardcoded values**: Magic numbers and strings throughout components
- **Large component files**: Canvas.tsx (813 lines) and GeneratedComponent.tsx (796 lines) need refactoring
- **Missing package-lock.json**: Dependency versions not locked

### Positive Aspects:
- **Modern technology stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Component architecture**: Good separation of concerns in most areas
- **Accessibility considerations**: Proper ARIA attributes in most components
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind

### Security Considerations:
- No authentication implementation visible
- API keys handled in frontend (potential exposure)
- Missing input validation and rate limiting

Non existent: 
Typescript config: already proper
Missing services 

True: 
XSS Vulnerability
Large comp files
misssing package.json
poor error handling
hardcoded api key exposure
console logs in prod code
hardcoded values throughout code
